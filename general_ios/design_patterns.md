# Design Pattern
A Design Pattern is a proven solution to a common problem. With software, it is usually complexity. 

Right now all our code and logic are written in one script making it hard to read and maintain. 

Various design patterns are developed over the years to manage complexity. 

Design patterns are very subjective and there are many popular design patterns out there such as:
- Object Pool
- MVP
- MVC
- Memento
- MVVM
- VIPER, etc..

At the end of the day, there isn't just one best design pattern. A design pattern is just an architecture blueprint to your problem, and it really depends on the problem and style.

## MVC
MVC design pattern is design pattern of choice by Apple.

The software is split into three components:
1. Model: Data & Logic
2. View: User Interface
3. Controller: Mediator

The key idea is to ensure that the model and the view do not directly communicate each other.

This is very useful for app development, because a change in the model would not result a change in the view, and vice versa.
